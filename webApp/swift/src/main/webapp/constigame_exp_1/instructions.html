<h1>Instructions SWiFT experiment "constigame_exp_1"</h1>
<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment!<br />
<br />
Could you do the following in the given order:
<ul>
   <li>Establish that you already participated in <emph>fluencygame_exp_2014.07.03</emph>: a game in which you had to translate a given text fragment as fluently as possible. If that is not the case, do not play on, but contact the experimenter.</li>
   <li>Become aware that you can always return to these instructions, by clicking the "Instructions" item in the menu at the left. Try this now by clicking another menu-item, and then return to these instructions.</li>
   <li>Create a user account by clicking "Sign Up" in the menu at the left. You will be logged in automatically after this. You can see this because the menu will change.</li>
   <li>Then thoroughly study the help file of the fluencygame by clicking the Help menu item at the left. <b>Please really do this, otherwise you will mess up the statistics because you are not prepared well enough.</b><br />
   </li>
   <li>Only after you have read the help file precisely (see previous point): play the fluency game pressing "Start Fluency Session". <b>Important: repeat the game until you have the feeling you cannot improve anymore, as many times as needed.</b> Squeeze everything out of it. It is a game: the quicker, the higher the final score! You are still improving if you continue to make fewer errors, and/or translate more quickly. However, please, do not play longer than 15 to 20 minutes in total... (I don't want to contribute to overstrained testers!).<br />
   </li>
</ul>
</p>

Thanks!
