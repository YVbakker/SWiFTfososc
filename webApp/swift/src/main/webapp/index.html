<h1>Instructions SWiFT experiment "fluencygame_exp_2014.07.03"</h1>
<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment!<br />
<br />
Could you do the following in the given order:
<ul>
   <li>First, be certain that you are sitting behind a computer with a <b>good, real (not virtual), keyboard</b>, so that you can type fast, while still seeing the screen. (So, not a smartphone or a tablet without external keyboard).</li>
   <li>Become aware that you can always return to these instructions, by clicking the "Instructions" item in the menu at the left. Try this now by clicking another menu-item, and then return to these instructions.</li>
   <li>Create a user account by clicking "Sign Up" in the menu at the left. You will be logged in automatically after this. You can see this because the menu will change.</li>
   <li>Then thoroughly study the help file of the fluencygame by clicking the Help menu item at the left. <b>Please really do this, otherwise you will mess up the statistics because you are not prepared well enough.</b><br />
   </li>
   <li>Only after you have read the help file precisely (see previous point): play the fluency game pressing "Start Fluency Session". Repeat the game, until you have the feeling you cannot improve anymore. You are still improveming if you continue to make fewer errors, and translate more quickly. However, do not play longer than 20 minutes in total... <br />
   </li>
</ul>
