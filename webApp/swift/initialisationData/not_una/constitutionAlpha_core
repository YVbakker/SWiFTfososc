<h2 class="western">0. Guideline: game rules and constitution</h2>
<p>Acquaint yourself with the rules of the game, and with the definitions in this constitution.</p>
<h2 class="western">1. Definition: target language Folminqua</h2>
<p>The SWiFT game makes use of a very simple computationally transparent language: Folminqua. One thing you have to understand about Folminqua is that you are free to (or better: must)
introduce new words. Compared to a normal language (English) it
could be seen as a language with a grammar, but with a minimum of
predefined words. In a sense you extend the language (with new words)
while you are using it!</p>
<!--There is not one computationally transparent language. Just as with human languages, their many.--> 
<p>The target language is defined as follows. A document in
Folminqua consists of a set of sentences, and sentences of a
sequence of words and auxiliary symbols. Lets first explain the
words, then the sentences and after that the documents.</p>
<h3 class="western">1.1 Words</h3>
<p>The words in Folminqua come in two flavours: constants and
predicates.</p>
<h4 class="western">1.1.1 Constants</h4>
<p>A constant is a word that stands for a certain entity (which could
be a person, a table, an armadillo, you name it). Examples of
constants in Folminqua are:</p>
<pre>c1
YanArthusBertrand 
oeirUij
pres_hujintao</pre>
<b>[y2012.m05.d30.h15.m30.s41 WARNING: due to a bug, constants must start with a lower case letter. In the rest of the constant you are free to use both capitals and lower case letters.]</b>
<p>You are free to choose any constant for a thing you want to refer
to. You can choose the constant <code>YanArthusBertrand</code> to represent documentary maker Yan Arthus-Bertrand, but you could just as well have chosen <code>c1</code>. Although you
are free to choose any constant to refer to the entity you have in
mind, you must stick to your choice throughout the document. Each new
occurrence of the same constant in the document, thus, refers to the
same entity. On the other hand, you are free to connect different
constants to the same entity, as long as not in conflict with the yet
to explain equal or inequal sentences.</p>
<h4 class="western">1.1.2 Predicates</h4>
<p>A predicate stands for a certain relation between entities.
Examples of predicates are:</p>
<pre>p
dlkfjiwjef
is_father_of
dk
likes</pre>
<p>Just as with constants, you are free to choose any predicate for a
relation you want to refer to. Again, you must stick to your choice
throughout the document. Each predicate has a fixed number of
entities it expresses a relation between. In Folminqua, simple as
it is, this number must always be exactly 2.</p>
<p>On the other
hand, you are free to connect different constants to the same entity,
as long as not in conflict with the yet to explain equal or inequal
sentences</p>
<h3 class="western">1.2 Sentences</h3>
<p>A sentence expresses some state of affairs. There are three types of sentences: predicate, equal and inequal sentences.</p> 

<h4>1.2.1 Predicate sentence</h4>
<p>An example of a predicate sentence is the following:</p>
<pre>p(c1,c2)</pre>
In the sentence above <code>p</code> is a predicate, and <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> are constants. It expresses that the relation associated with predicate <code>p</code> exists between <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> (and in that order, will be explained). Suppose that in your document, you have chosen <code>c1</code> to represent Yan Arthus-Bertrand, <code>c2</code> the movie Home, and <code>p(x,y)</code> to represent the relation ``<code>x</code> is documentary maker of <code>y</code>''. Then the above example-sentence expresses: ``Yan Arthus-Bertrand is documentary maker of Home''.
The following is another example of a predicate sentence:
<pre>p({a,b},{c,d})</pre>
<p>This notation is intended to save you some writing work. It is an abbreviation for expressing all of the following sentences at once:
<pre>p(a,c)
p(a,d)
p(b,c)
p(b,d)</pre>
Thus, all predicate sentences with any single constant of the first list of constants, combined with any single element of the second list of constants. Other examples are:
<pre>p({a},{c,d})</pre>
Equivalent to:
<pre>p(a,c)
p(a,d)
</pre>
and 
<pre>p({a,b},{d})</pre>
Equivalent to:<pre>p(a,d)
p(b,d)</pre></p>
Moreover, a list with only one constant, such as <code>{a}</code> is equivalent to writing down that constant itself, thus <code>a</code>. For example:
<pre>p({a},{c,d})</pre>
is equivalent to writing
<pre>p(a,{c,d})</pre>

<!-- Note a few things:
<ul>
   <li>The order of constants is in a predicate sentence is important. p(c2,c1) and p(c1,c2) do not necessarily express the same information, in the example abo</p>
-->
<h4>1.2.2 Equality sentence</h4>
An equality sentence expresses that all constants mentioned in it, refer to the same entity. An example is:
<pre>equal(c1,c2,c3)</pre>
<p>This expresses that the constants <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code> and <code>c3</code> refer to the same entity. The list of constants in the equal sentence must be at least 2.</p>
<h4>1.2.3 Inequality sentence</h4>
<pre>inequal(c1,c2,c3)</pre>
<p>This expresses that the constants <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>, <code>c3</code> refer to mutually
distinct entities. For the rest it has the same properties as equal.</p>
<h3 class="western">1.3 Documents</h3>
<p>A document is a sequence of sentences separated by newlines:</p>
<pre>p({a,b},{b,c,Yan})
p({b},{c})
equal(b,c)</pre>
<br/><br/>

<!-- 
<p>The meaning of constants and predicates do never change within a
document. p stands for the same relation and c1 and c2 for the same
entities throughout the document.</p>
<p>Which stand for some entities, and p is a relation. This statement
expresses</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>p stands for the relation “x is a father of y”</p>
<p><br/><br/>
</p>
<p>equal(a,b,c) a, band</p>
